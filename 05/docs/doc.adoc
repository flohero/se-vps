== Stock Visualization
An asynchronous implementation of the stock visualization.
Most of the work has been done during the lecture.

.Sequential
[source,csharp]
----
include::../Quandl.UI/QuandlViewer.cs[lines=32..46]
----

=== With TPL

.TPL
[source,csharp]
----
include::../Quandl.UI/QuandlViewer.cs[lines=89..115]
----

=== With async/await
The async/await version is shorter than the TPL approach.

.async/await
[source,csharp]
----
include::../Quandl.UI/QuandlViewer.cs[lines=117..134]
----

== Wator World
=== Approach
The matrix of wator world is divided into mutliple parts, this can be done with an partitioner.
The number of partitions should be even or it will produce race conditions.

.Partitioning the matrix
[source,csharp]
----
include::../Wator/Improved4/Improved4WaterWorld.cs[lines=91..91]
----

The matrix randomization algorithm implements two new parameters for upper and lower bounds.

[source,csharp]
----
include::../Wator/Improved4/Improved4WaterWorld.cs[lines=301..310]
----

Last each partition is executed.

[source,csharp]
----
include::../Wator/Improved4/Improved4WaterWorld.cs[lines=104..153]
----

*Advantages*

- Simple by using async/await
- really fast

*Disadvantages*

- Not the whole matrix gets randomized, but only parts of it
