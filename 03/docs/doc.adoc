== Simple Mandelbrotgenerator
This implementation was finished during the exercise.

[source,csharp]
----
include::../MandelbrotGenerator/SyncImageGenerator.cs[]
----

== Asynchronous Image Generation
The first solution was also implemented during the exercise.

.AsyncThreadImageGenerator
[source,csharp]
----
include::../MandelbrotGenerator/AsyncThreadImageGenerator.cs[]
----

Another ImageGenerator was implemented using a BackgroundWorker.
A problem was that the BackgroundWorker could not be cancelled and started again, so it is just re-instantiated.

.BackgroundWorkerImageGenerator
[source,csharp]
----
include::../MandelbrotGenerator/BackgroundWorkerImageGenerator.cs[]
----

== Partition the Work
The area is partitioned according to the number of available workers.
The underlying implementation uses threads to generate the different parts of the image.

.PartitionedImageGenerator
[source,csharp]
----
include::../MandelbrotGenerator/PartitionedImageGenerator.cs[]
----

== Tests
